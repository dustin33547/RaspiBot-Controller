# RaspiBot Controller
This is a very simple Python program that creates a small GUI to control a raspberry pi with motor controller and camera.

## Requirements
You will need to install the python package: gpiozero
The latest Raspian versions have this preinstalled.

You will also need a Raspberry Pi camera. This is plugged directly into the board (not into the USB)
In the Raspberry Pi's settings menu, you will need to enable the camera.
